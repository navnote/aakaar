				<sup className="text-sm">{"<h1>"}</sup>The Joke Tax Chronicles
			</h1>
			<p>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<p>"}</sup>
				Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who
				spent all day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him
				with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.
			</p>
			<h2>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<h2>"}</sup>The King's Plan
			</h2>
			<p>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<p>"}</sup>
				The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with{" "}
				<a href="#">a brilliant plan</a>: he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<blockquote>"}</sup>
				"After all," he said, "everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair
				that they should pay for the privilege."
			</blockquote>
			<h3>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<h3>"}</sup>The Joke Tax
			</h3>
			<p>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<p>"}</sup>
				The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but
				the king was firm:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<sup className="text-sm">{"<li>"}</sup>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins
				</li>
				<li>
					<sup className="text-sm">{"<li>"}</sup>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold
					coins
				</li>
				<li>
					<sup className="text-sm">{"<li>"}</sup>3rd level of one-liners : 20
					gold coins
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<p>"}</sup>
				As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a
				gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the king's
				foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<h3>"}</sup>Jokester's Revolt
			</h3>
			<p>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<p>"}</sup>
				Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and
				leaving jokes all over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup,
				even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to
				stop Jokester.
			</p>
			<p>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<p>"}</sup>
				And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes
				left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And
				once they started laughing, they couldn't stop.
			</p>
			<h3>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<h3>"}</sup>The People's Rebellion
			</h3>
			<p>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<p>"}</sup>
				The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to
				tell jokes and puns again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on the
				joke.
			</p>
			<div>
				<span className="text-sm">
					{"<table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, <td>"}
				</span>
				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>King's Treasury</th>
							<th>People's happiness</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Empty</td>
							<td>Overflowing</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Modest</td>
							<td>Satisfied</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Full</td>
							<td>Ecstatic</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
			</div>
			<p>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<p>"}</sup>
				The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the error
				of his ways and repealed the joke tax. Jokester was declared a hero, and
				the kingdom lived happily ever after.
			</p>
			<p>
				<sup className="text-sm">{"<p>"}</sup>
				The moral of the story is: never underestimate the power of a good laugh
				and always be careful of bad ideas.
